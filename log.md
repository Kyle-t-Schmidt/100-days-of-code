# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: First I had to refresh myself on how to use git from the command line to update this log in github. Next I completed the "Basic HTML and HTML5" exercises on freeCodeCamp.org. For a change of pace I went over to www.mooc.fi to continue sharpening my Java skills.

**Thoughts:**: HTML is not one of my favorite topics but I'll continue to learn and use it as I learn more front end development. I really enjoy Java and want to get better at it.

### Day 2: September 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I continued working through the University of Helsinki Java 2 course, before heading back over to free code camp to begin learning CSS. I completed several exercises workign with hashmaps.

**Thoughts:**: Front end development is new for me. I need more practice; I'm looking forward to working on a project after working through the exercises. I feel comfortable with Java but am enjoying sharpening my skills.

### Day 3: September 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I focused on CSS today and made a lot of progress. I completed the basic CSS challenges on freecodecamp.org.

**Thoughts:**: There is a lot to remember with CSS and I'm a bit confused on when to use different style techniques - variables, inline style elements and CSS style selectors. I'm sure this will become more clear as I continue to learn.
