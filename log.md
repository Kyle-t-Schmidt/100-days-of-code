# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: First I had to refresh myself on how to use git from the command line to update this log in github. Next I completed the "Basic HTML and HTML5" exercises on freeCodeCamp.org. For a change of pace I went over to www.mooc.fi to continue sharpening my Java skills.

**Thoughts:**: HTML is not one of my favorite topics but I'll continue to learn and use it as I learn more front end development. I really enjoy Java and want to get better at it.

### Day 2: September 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I continued working through the University of Helsinki Java 2 course, before heading back over to free code camp to begin learning CSS. I completed several exercises workign with hashmaps.

**Thoughts:**: Front end development is new for me. I need more practice; I'm looking forward to working on a project after working through the exercises. I feel comfortable with Java but am enjoying sharpening my skills.

### Day 3: September 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I focused on CSS today and made a lot of progress. I completed the basic CSS challenges on freecodecamp.org.

**Thoughts:**: There is a lot to remember with CSS and I'm a bit confused on when to use different style techniques - variables, inline style elements and CSS style selectors. I'm sure this will become more clear as I continue to learn.

### Day 4: October 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent time getting familiar with hashcode() and equals() methods in Java. I only completed a couple of exercises at the University of helsinki Java 2 course because I spent a lot of time reading and watching youtube video to fully understand the methods.

**Thoughts:**: I think I fully understand the methods and how to approach writing equals and hashcode methods.

### Day 5: October 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on Java programming in the University of Helsinki Java 2 course.

**Thoughts:**: Today was tough. My 10 month old daughter is sick and had been having an all day-long melt down. I still managed to get programming in while she slept.

### Day 6: October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on learning CSS from freecodecamp. I signed up for well paid geek's javascipt course, trying to learn a bit more about HTML and CSS before diving into that.

**Thoughts:**: CSS doesn't seem overly complex, but htere are so many different attributes to know.

### Day 7: October 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I started working on a project to build a KNN classifier class in Python using only Numpy. I also continued learning CSS.

**Thoughts:**: I needed a change of pace. I wouldn't say I am bored of CSS, just needed to work on somehting else for a bit.

### Day 8: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on my KNN classifier by adding to the data pre-processing method. Began learning Javascript.

**Thoughts:**: The KNN project is going to take longer than I initially thought.

### Day 9: October 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I added the one-hot encoding functionality to my KNN classifier project. Continued work on learning javascript.

**Thoughts:**: I'm glad I decided to go back and refresh myself on Data Science programming.

### Day 10: October 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the data preprocessing method of my KNN python project. I also started practicing javascript syntax.

**Thoughts:**: The python project is fun. I;m having to re-learn some of the numpy methods I haven't used in a while.

### Day 11: October 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I split the data preprocessing method into two methods: one for the trian data and one for the test data that way I can use the same feature map for one-hot encoding the non-numerical values.

**Thoughts:**: I did not feel like coding today, but I did it anyway!

### Day 12: October 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I began working on the method to determine the K nearest neighbors using euclidean distance. To determine the nearest neighbors I need to calculate the euclidean distance between each point in a test dataset and each point in a train dataaset. To avoid having huge lists to sort through I am only adding K number of disances to a list then only altering that lsit of 5 if a new disance is less than what is on the list.

**Thoughts:**: I'm feeling good about this project and learning a lot along he way.

### Day 13: October 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on my KNN project.

**Thoughts:**: I'm a bit frustrated, because I'm stuck on a seemingly simple problem. I'll get through it.

### Day 14: October 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on my KNN project.

**Thoughts:**: I Thought I was going to wrap up this project today but suprise, my program wasn't working as planned. I had to hunt down the source of the problem. I was able to find the issue and I have a plan to fix it.

### Day 15: October 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I am now in the debugging portion of my KNN project. I am very close to having a working product.

**Thoughts:**: Another small hiccup but I will push through. I'm very close to having a working program.

### Day 16: October 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: My KNN program works! I finished up de-bugging and finished up the initial coding. The program takes two csv files (a train file and a test file) preprocesses the data and uses KNN classification to predict the test classes. I used only numpy and base python to do this.

**Thoughts:**: I still need to add some notes to the program and I am considering refactoring to make the code more readable.
