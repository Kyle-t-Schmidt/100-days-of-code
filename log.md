## --- First attempt log below this point---

### Day 1: September 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: First I had to refresh myself on how to use git from the command line to update this log in github. Next I completed the "Basic HTML and HTML5" exercises on freeCodeCamp.org. For a change of pace I went over to www.mooc.fi to continue sharpening my Java skills.

**Thoughts:**: HTML is not one of my favorite topics but I'll continue to learn and use it as I learn more front end development. I really enjoy Java and want to get better at it.

### Day 3: September 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I focused on CSS today and made a lot of progress. I completed the basic CSS challenges on freecodecamp.org.

**Thoughts:**: There is a lot to remember with CSS and I'm a bit confused on when to use different style techniques - variables, inline style elements and CSS style selectors. I'm sure this will become more clear as I continue to learn.

**Link to work:** [CSS exercises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)


### Day 4: October 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent time getting familiar with hashcode() and equals() methods in Java. I only completed a couple of exercises at the University of helsinki Java 2 course because I spent a lot of time reading and watching youtube video to fully understand the methods.

**Thoughts:**: I think I fully understand the methods and how to approach writing equals and hashcode methods.

**Link to work:** [Java 2 course](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)


### Day 5: October 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on Java programming in the University of Helsinki Java 2 course.

**Thoughts:**: Today was tough. My 10 month old daughter is sick and had been having an all day-long melt down. I still managed to get programming in while she slept.

**Link to work:** [Java 2 course](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)


### Day 6: October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on learning CSS from freecodecamp. I signed up for well paid geek's javascipt course, trying to learn a bit more about HTML and CSS before diving into that.

**Thoughts:**: CSS doesn't seem overly complex, but htere are so many different attributes to know.

**Link to work:** [CSS exercises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)


### Day 7: October 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I started working on a project to build a KNN classifier class in Python using only Numpy. I also continued learning CSS.

**Thoughts:**: I needed a change of pace. I wouldn't say I am bored of CSS, just needed to work on somehting else for a bit.

### Day 10: October 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the data preprocessing method of my KNN python project. I also started practicing javascript syntax.

**Thoughts:**: The python project is fun. I;m having to re-learn some of the numpy methods I haven't used in a while.

**Link to work:** [javascript course](https://wellpaidgeek.teachable.com/) [KNN Project](https://github.com/Kyle-t-Schmidt/KNN-From-Scratch/)


### Day 11: October 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I split the data preprocessing method into two methods: one for the trian data and one for the test data that way I can use the same feature map for one-hot encoding the non-numerical values.

**Thoughts:**: I did not feel like coding today, but I did it anyway!

**Link to work:** [KNN Project](https://github.com/Kyle-t-Schmidt/KNN-From-Scratch/)


### Day 12: October 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I began working on the method to determine the K nearest neighbors using euclidean distance. To determine the nearest neighbors I need to calculate the euclidean distance between each point in a test dataset and each point in a train dataaset. To avoid having huge lists to sort through I am only adding K number of disances to a list then only altering that lsit of 5 if a new disance is less than what is on the list.

**Thoughts:**: I'm feeling good about this project and learning a lot along he way.

**Link to work:** [KNN Project](https://github.com/Kyle-t-Schmidt/KNN-From-Scratch/)


### Day 13: October 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on my KNN project.

**Thoughts:**: Another small hiccup but I will push through. I'm very close to having a working program.

**Link to work:** [KNN Project](https://github.com/Kyle-t-Schmidt/KNN-From-Scratch/)


### Day 16: October 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: My KNN program works! I finished up de-bugging and finished up the initial coding. The program takes two csv files (a train file and a test file) preprocesses the data and uses KNN classification to predict the test classes. I used only numpy and base python to do this.

**Thoughts:**: I still need to add some notes to the program and I am considering refactoring to make the code more readable.

**Link to work:** [KNN Project](https://github.com/Kyle-t-Schmidt/KNN-From-Scratch/)


### Day 17: October 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on learning more CSS at freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:**: I would like to revisit my KNN program and look into refactoring and possibly trying to speed the program up. Right now I am on vacation visiting family and will be through Saturday so I won't have much time to focus on a bigger project for a bit.

**Link to work:** [CSS exercises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)


### Day 18: October 15, 2020
