# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: First I had to refresh myself on how to use git from the command line to update this log in github. Next I completed the "Basic HTML and HTML5" exercises on freeCodeCamp.org. For a change of pace I went over to www.mooc.fi to continue sharpening my Java skills.

**Thoughts:**: HTML is not one of my favorite topics but I'll continue to learn and use it as I learn more front end development. I really enjoy Java and want to get better at it.

### Day 2: September 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I continued working through the University of Helsinki Java 2 course, before heading back over to free code camp to begin learning CSS. I completed several exercises workign with hashmaps.

**Thoughts:**: Front end development is new for me. I need more practice; I'm looking forward to working on a project after working through the exercises. I feel comfortable with Java but am enjoying sharpening my skills.

### Day 3: September 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I focused on CSS today and made a lot of progress. I completed the basic CSS challenges on freecodecamp.org.

**Thoughts:**: There is a lot to remember with CSS and I'm a bit confused on when to use different style techniques - variables, inline style elements and CSS style selectors. I'm sure this will become more clear as I continue to learn.

### Day 4: October 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent time getting familiar with hashcode() and equals() methods in Java. I only completed a couple of exercises at the University of helsinki Java 2 course because I spent a lot of time reading and watching youtube video to fully understand the methods.

**Thoughts:**: I think I fully understand the methods and how to approach writing equals and hashcode methods.

### Day 5: October 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on Java programming in the University of Helsinki Java 2 course.

**Thoughts:**: Today was tough. My 10 month old daughter is sick and had been having an all day-long melt down. I still managed to get programming in while she slept.

### Day 6: October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on learning CSS from freecodecamp. I signed up for well paid geek's javascipt course, trying to learn a bit more about HTML and CSS before diving into that.

**Thoughts:**: CSS doesn't seem overly complex, but htere are so many different attributes to know.

### Day 7: October 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I started working on a project to build a KNN classifier class in Python using only Numpy. I also continued learning CSS.

**Thoughts:**: I needed a change of pace. I wouldn't say I am bored of CSS, just needed to work on somehting else for a bit.

### Day 8: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on my KNN classifier by adding to the data pre-processing method. Began learning Javascript.

**Thoughts:**: The KNN project is going to take longer than I initially thought.

### Day 9: October 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I added the one-hot encoding functionality to my KNN classifier project. Continued work on learning javascript.

**Thoughts:**: I'm glad I decided to go back and refresh myself on Data Science programming.

### Day 10: October 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the data preprocessing method of my KNN python project. I also started practicing javascript syntax.

**Thoughts:**: The python project is fun. I;m having to re-learn some of the numpy methods I haven't used in a while.
